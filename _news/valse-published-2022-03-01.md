[VALSE: A Task-Independent Benchmark for Vision and Language Models Centered on Linguistic Phenomena](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.567/) accepted for publication at **ACL 2022**. We investigate to what extent existing pretrained vision-and-language models ground text on vision and vice-versa using counterfactuals and focusing on fine-grained linguistic phenomena!
