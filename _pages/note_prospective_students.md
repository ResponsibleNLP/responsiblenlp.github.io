### If you are looking for a PhD position

Open PhD / post-doc positions are advertised in the [Amsterdam UMC vacancies website](https://werkenbij.amsterdamumc.org/en) and also on this website's [main page](/). If you do not see any positions advertised, it means that I currently have no funding to accept new PhD students.

If you have your own PhD scholarship, you are welcome to reach out.

In both cases, please always mention: 1) your background, 2) why are you interested in working with me (be as specific as possible, it is always a good idea to refer to a concrete project / publication of our group), and 3) what kind of sholarship you have (or what open vacancy you are referring to).

**Please note that I may not be able to reply to emails if you do not follow these guidelines.**
