**Prospective students:** please read [this note](note-prospective-students/) before emailing me.


#### Background. 
I am assistant professor at the Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam UMC location AMC, University of Amsterdam (UvA).
I was recently awarded an [NWO AiNed Fellowship](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/spotlight/building-models-to-enable-greater-use-of-ai-in-the-health-care-system.htm) and lead the NLP4Health Lab Amsterdam.
Before that, I was a [Marie-Curie Global Fellow](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/838188) in the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the UvA](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) and [New York University's Center for Data Science](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/).
I obtained my PhD from Dublin City University where I was a member of the [ADAPT Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/).
I also hold an Erasmus Mundus Master in Natural Language Processing and Human Language Technology, a MSc degree in Computer Science, and a BSc degree in Information Systems.


#### Research. 
I work on human-centric and responsible Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods for high-stakes applications with a strong focus on healthcare.
My team and I propose methods with a focus on the *Dutch and European healthcare ecosystems*.
Some of the research topics I am interested in include NLP and ML methods that are *transparent, interpretable, and explainable*, that can *efficiently unlearn information*, that *ensure fairness and (patient) privacy*, that *prevent and mitigate bias*, that *cope with data scarcity* and that *generalise across (patient) distributions and (downstream) tasks*.

My main research line tackles challenges surrounding clinical NLP, but I also research methods to model the complex interaction between language and other modalities (e.g., images, videos, audio), knowledge graphs, world, and commonsense knowledge.
